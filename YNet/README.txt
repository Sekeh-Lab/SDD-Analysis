To run YNet we provide the Full_YNet.ipynb notebook. This was initially run within Google Colab by mounting the drive containing the directory, so these steps will need to be changed accordingly.
The notebook contains the necessary lines to attempt each experiment (training/testing with each separate class for inD and SDD, and training with one class and testing with another). 
The processed data is provided within ./data
